                This was one of the hardest projects I've worked on. BUT, it was  
                a very interesting experience. I've learned a lot from other great people while working with 
                them. My teammates were very cooperative and helpful. It gave me a taste of how machine learning 
                problems and software projects both work outside of the classroom.

                Since this isn't my resume or LinkedIn where I have to cram everything and pretend
                that I'm the MVP (or intern in this case) when I know our work shows I'm not. Even while I 
                was working on various parts in our projects for Vodafone, I honestly didn't know what kind 
                my work was classified as. My advisor claimed I had the role of a data engineer. Our Liasions
                had no idea and I was assigned the machine learning role. Eventually, I come to learn that 
                machine learning is actually accurate. Only after some interviews that I managed to get since
                my graduation had confirmed that. With this information, now I'll get down to our projects 
                and my responsibilities.

                My team's tasks were to use the confidential Covid-19 data to explain the Covid-19 situation
                at the time to a general audience. We were also told to find any possible unknown predictors
                for covid-19 patients of four particular cases, and minimizing the number of predictors 
                while maximizing our model's accuracy. This includes visualizations and presentations 
                that are available to and easily understood by the general public.
                All of my teammates followed the common strategy of learning all of our possible tools and 
                focus on what we are comfortable with to achieve our goals.
                I did data preparation, data analysis, analyzing our results, and visualize 
                the results and analytics all through Python and it's libraries, and Jupyter Notebook. And 
                front-end development when needed using HTML5 and CSS. I also contributed to training and 
                analyzing our models. However, I did not contribute to visualizations created in Tableau or 
                D3 library of Javascript that were used. I also did not contribute to the development of our 
                mobile application. Our machine learning lead was Fredi Garcia. Initially my team elected me 
                to be machine learning lead, but I vetoed my team's decision because I was not confident in 
                management tasks. I was more focused on making progress on our work, and at times I had to 
                manage in my lead's place. I used different algorithms to prepare the data before using the 
                prepared data on logistic regression models. The picture on the left shows a graph I've made 
                to visualize the results of using the Chi Square Test of fitness after preparing the data 
                using KNN. The data was for mortality cases for a specific general population.

                The image above on the left is the analysis of different algorithms I had used to prepare the 
                data for hospitalization cases for another specific population. This graph confirmed my lead's 
                work that approximately 18 features is the least number of features with an accuracy of about 83%,
                a reasonable tradeoff.
                This also confirmed his assumptions that KNN outperformed Iterative Imputation.
                The image above on the right is the result of using RFE to reduce the number of predictors for 
                mortality cases of another specific population.
                <br>
                 To be clear, I don't remember the results of the of Fredi's work. We both worked together when 
                 opportunities arise and independently. My work confirms that my team's and his works are accurate.
