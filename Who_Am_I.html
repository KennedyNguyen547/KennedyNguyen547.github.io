                My name is Kennedy Nguyen. I do have a middle name, but I prefer not to use it as much as I can.
                I'll skip my grade school years. I mean, who really cares in this time where people want immediate
                answers. Google is at our fingertips when we need something reasonable. And there isn't much in my 
                childhood.
                <br>
                My academic career began when I started at East Los Angeles College. I originally was an 
                undecided major who later leaned towards history and philosophy. Then I jumped over to mathematics 
                and programming. I was a terrible programmer when I started. The first language I started to 
                understand programming was C++. Then I jumped over to physics. Initially, I didn't like physics, but that changed 
                when I met a tough but caring professor. I pretty much took enough classes to get associates degrees
                for mathematics, philosophy, physics, and computer science. Emphasis on <b>for</b> since programs for the 
                latter 3 subjects didn't not exist until after I transferred. And I never bothered with the mathematics
                one.
                <br>
                When I transferred to CSULA, I convinced myself to get my bachelors degree within two years. My first 
                year at CSULA covered a lot of what I know now. Including my knowledge of HTML and CSS you're reading 
                here. Though I'll admit I'm still relearning with help from a friend.
                I still feel like my decision to pick all the electives that I thought were useful in my second year was 
                a mistake. All of my electives were considered hard electives for senior students, and many of them were 
                prerequisites for graduate level studies. After my grades were finalized for graduation, <span class="bold"> 
                 I didn't expect to get degree honors.</span>
                <span class="bold">I also felt that turning down the opportunity to advance into CSULA's graduate 
                program was another mistake I made.</span> Oh, well...
                Despite my terrible life decisions, my senior year was probably the most interesting year during my stay.
                <br>
                But I personally wanted to work for while before considering graduate school.

                I think I'm pathetic that I know more programming languages than human languages. Despite my surname, I 
                am terrible at Vietnamese. And despite my programming history that I wrote below, I still don't trust myself
                to consider myself a good programmer.
                <br>
                I chose computer science because I hoped for a lasting career that makes me useful, but the field also 
                encompassed everything I'm interested in. Video games, games, applied logic, audio editing, audio mixing,
                applied math, graphics and graphical editing, data analysis, applied physics, and not having to lift physically 
                heavy objects or deal with physical mechanical problems I am terrible at. Being honest, I was going to give up
                back in 2018. My family had wanted to throw me out. My classes didn't amount to any associates at the time 
                despite being over the units for a community college student. My close relatives wanted me to get an associate's 
                degree and stop there. Of course, me being me, my relationship with my family is tied to whether I could make 
                money or not. So of course that relationship was not so good at the time (though it still right now). 
                MESA didn't want to hire me as a tutor. I still had to complete some more classes before I could transfer.
                My family had convinced me that everything I did and learned up to that point was useless.
                My old college friend, David Holmes, was pretty much my shoulder to cry on for days at that time. I was so close 
                to taking on his idea to work at Costco and just give up on getting a four-year degree. Thinking back to that now, 
                I would say he's pretty right. My degree now amounts to being meaningless...
                But yeah, I really appreciate him for changing my mind and keeping my sanity.
                I truly appreciate Professor Viken Kiledjian to be the only instructor to recognize me 
                as a tutor. I helped students for the physics department.
                And thanks to CSULA too, for being the only university to accept me.
                I probably deserved the UC (and other CSU) reject of the year award.
                I know it's tough getting a job in the tech industry. LinkedIn is great for finding job posts, 
                and for thinking I was an employer while I was unemployed. I really feel bad for those who had to 
                resort to begging on LinkedIn to get attention. I don't want to resort to doing that.

                    Bootleg Programmer
                </span>
                <br>
                I've been programming in C++ since 2013, and I only recently realized that I've been using it for as 
                long as I've had my California driver's license. Java was my second programming language. I took a class 
                in Java in 2012, and never touched it again until I transferred into CSULA. Though, I haven't touched it 
                again after graduation. I have used HTML, JavaScript, and CSS on and off since my web development class at
                CSULA. I used to hate web development, mainly because of the professor I had. But recent projects I've 
                worked with, and help from a friend who's emphasis was mobile development, changed my mind.I have been playing with Python since 2018, but I feel like I've learned much more during 
                senior year. My senior year was probably the most interesting because I took some of the hardest electives, 
                and I actually liked my capstone project that involved being a year-long intern for Vodafone. I felt I 
                learned more Python (through jupyter notebook) during my data science and machine learning classes, and my 
                internship with Vodafone. I mainly worked on using Python during my internship, but I used to use Tableau 
                and Javascript as well. This might surprise you, but I don't really write "pythonic" code in python. I've 
                learned SQL during my stay at CSULA, and a recent project forced me to learn accessing a relational database 
                through Python.
                Before, I used to think that machine learning was more for forecasting or to make things 
                "more intelligent". But I learned that I could do visualizations, find the more useful parts of data, use 
                machine learning algorithms to prepare data that are to be fed into more machine learning algorithms, and, 
                what caught my interest, finding useful information that are the least obvious.

                </span>
                <br>
                Same story with web development for my relationship with physics. I initially didn't like physics. I came to 
                like physics when I figured out the logic and mechanics since 2018, and when I ran into the infamous Viken 
                Kiledjian. He really showed me how applicable physics is (and how underrated math is) since 2015. 
                After repeating for my first few C++ classes, my second C++ instructor helped me learned much better, I got 
                interested in learning how computer graphics and numerical algorithms worked. I was motivated to solve 
                my previous programming instructors' works and decided to help other students on their path of learning 
                programming since 2016.
                Around the same time, a friend of mines, he's a computer engineer now, got me into learning audio editing 
                and recording. I didn't know until after the fact that he worked as a real good party DJ while he was working as a math tutor and 
                studying computer engineering at CSUN. I don't believe myself to be a good mathematician, though almost 
                everyone I've met tell me otherwise.
