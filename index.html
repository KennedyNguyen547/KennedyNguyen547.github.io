                    Hello. Yeah I'm not too good with greetings. I'm pretty sure "Hello" is old school now.
                    I'm Kennedy, and I honestly don't care if you call me something else. Well, as long as it's 
                    not controversial or embarrasing.
                    Anyways, this is just a page for people who want to know me. Well, aside from my few friends 
                    and those who I had helped through out my career as a student. 
                    As you can see on the right, this is a picture of myself just recently. I know I'm terrible at selfies,
                    if this is considered one.<br>
                    Most of my friends and some of my former co-workers on projects or classmates would know I used to have
                    shoulder-length hair and a beard that spanned down to the top of my chest. Good times...
                    Since California officially lifted many of the Covid-19 restrictions, I had my hair short again and
                    said good-bye to my beard.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Now onto the who I am. If you want the TL;DR, look on the right side.</b> <br>
                    I graduated from California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA) with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science in 
                    May 2021. I was awarded <i>Summa Cum Laude</i> for having a 3.923 GPA, though I personally feel like I don't deserve it.
                    My former co-workers and classmates would say otherwise. My elective studies focused on Data Science, Machine Learning,
                    Relational Databases, Artificial Intelligence, Cryptography, and Intelligent Agents in Learning Environments (my focus was 
                    Game-Based Learning). I personally believe that CSULA is a school for reformers, or for people who want to change.

                        This was one of the hardest projects I've worked on. BUT, it was

                        You're probably wondering why I wrote this. I came across a person on Discord
                        who had a friend that needed help writing a post fix calculator program for a C++ class.
                        My motivation to help that person (that I don't know personally)...
