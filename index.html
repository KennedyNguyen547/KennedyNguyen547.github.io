                Hello, people. I'll just keep it simple and short about myself here.
                I'm a computer science graduate from Cal State LA (California State University, Los Angeles).
                I received my B.S in Computer Science in 2021. Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, I had enjoyed the challenges 
                I encountered and worked on during my academic career. I had the great fortune to study under great instructors 
                that I now know have retired from teaching, some have moved onto other positions outside of academics or retired completely.
    
                <br>
                <br>
                My current career goal is looking for a junior software engineering, data science, or machine learning position.
