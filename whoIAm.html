                If your here, then here I go.
                My name is Kennedy Nguyen. I do have a middle name, but I don't care much about it. Don't worry if you butcher my first or last name.
                I spent almost all my life living in Los Angeles. I was a terrible grade school student. I barely graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School 
                in Los Angeles, CA in 2010. I went to East Los Angeles College (ELAC) and began my academic career there.

                College Life
            </div>
            <par class="paragraph">
                I studied, in chronological order, history, 
                philosophy, mathematics, computer science, and then physics. I've repeated some of my science classes in between my almost nine year stay at ELAC.
                When I entered ELAC, I was repeating classes I already took in high school. I was very interested in philsophy. Although I was not that great of an 
                essay writer at the time, and I learned later that mathematics seemed easier to me. I really appreciate some of my old instructors from there, not all but 
                some. If I go by my experiences, then <b>Viken Kiledjian</b> (one of my physics instructor) is definitely up there in that small list of instructors I appreciate. 
                Though my philosophy major was short lived, I really enjoyed philosophy. I'll admit that the field of existentialism really got me 
                interested, even though it's not popular here in the U.S. I did some studies into numerical algorithms when my algorithms and data structures 
                instructor got me interested. I became an unofficial tutor for the mathematics department for their C++ classes from 2016 - 2018.
                 Initially I thought I was going to hate physics because I had no idea what I was doing. After some repeats, I start 
                to like physics over time when I understood how the problems were solved and how applicable the topics were in the real world.
                Viken Kiledjian had me become a tutor for the physics department from the Summer of 2018 up until 
                I transferred to California State University, Los Angeles, or CSULA, in the Summer of 2019.

            <par class="paragraph">
                I know CSULA has a mixed reputation as a school. I personally like CSULA because I see it as a school that gives people like me a chance to 
                reform myself and to get an education where other universities would've rejected people like me.
                In the Fall of 2019, I continued my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at CSULA. 
                I mainly studied relational databases, artificial intelligence, 
                data science, machine learning, cryptography (though I've forgotten the algorithms now), and intelligent agents in
                learning environments in the context of elements of games and related pedagogies.
                I have taken a few undergraduate courses outside my major, in Creative Writing (English) and Ethics (Philosophy).
                I graduated in 2021 with a 3.923 GPA. I was one of eight CS graduates out of 168 who earned <i>Summa Cum Laude</i> that year.
                Though I personally don't feel special about earning it.

            Goals and Interests

        <par class="paragraph">
            I'm currently still looking for that elusive junior "office" job with an engineer's salary that I envisioned myself having 
            since I entered college.
            I want to work for some time before considering going to graduate school. My only motivations behind going to graduate
            school are for the challenges that entails and to be an instructor in my far future. I personally believe that every student is capable
            of being brilliant or successful in their education endeavors and in their futures. From my experiences as a STEM tutor,
             I rarely find students who can 
            achieve academic success regardless of their instructors' abilities in this time. So, often times the 
            instructor makes a huge difference in the rest of the students' academic success.

            Not So Academic Interests
        </div>
        <par class="paragraph">
            I really love games. I am sure most people in this time do, mainly due to video games.
            Though I have played less over the last several years since I know my reflexes and mental acuity aren't as great
            as they were when I was still a college student.
            I also really love comedy. I do think that comedy is a great way to expose the depths of controversial ideas.
            I like listening to music. My college friends got me into EDM. Some of my friends who I still keep in touch, 
            who were also graduates in computer majors, are really great DJs.
            Whenever I get the opportunity to work with either of them, I'd join them to work on some 
            music projects.
            I like reading Japanese comics, and western political comics, as well as reading surrealistic 
            fiction that reflect modern philosophical, psychological, or political ideas. 
            I like reading memes. I like the message or motivation behind them.
